# A hands-on tutorial on open source research in structural dynamics and image-based experimental modal analysis

The tutorial was prepared for the [IMAC XXXVIII conference, February 8-11, 2021](https://sem.org/imac)


1. Open-source concepts in scientific research
2. Open-source tools for structural dynamics
3. High-speed camera measureemnts in structural dynamics
4.  Real-life example of image-based vibration measurement
