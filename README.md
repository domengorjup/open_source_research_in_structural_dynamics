# A hands-on tutorial on open source research in structural dynamics and image-based experimental modal analysis

The tutorial was prepared for the [IMAC XXXVIII conference, February 8-11, 2021](https://sem.org/imac)

## Contents

1. Open-source concepts in scientific research
2. Open-source tools for structural dynamics
3. High-speed camera measureemnts in structural dynamics
4. Real-life example of image-based vibration measurement

## Code

You can find the executable totorial notebook in the ["Open-Source Research in Structural Dynamics, Image-Based Experimental Modal Analysis"](./Open-Source%20Research%20in%20Structural%20Dynamics%2C%20Image-Based%20Experimental%20Modal%20Analysis.ipynb) file.
